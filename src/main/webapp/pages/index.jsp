<h2>A Note:</h2>

<p>My name is Mike Croteau, the CEO and Founder of
    Grazie! An online gratuities platform.</p>

<p>There's Giselle at McDonalds,
    Cairo at Denny's and Mint at Walmart! All of these people
    work tirelessly to bring you joy. Why should they make millions
    less than the CEOs that run the companies. Send tips to people you
    love for doing the work they love. Our goal is to help improve the income
    disparity that exists!</p>

<p>Mike</p>
<h2>The Schpiel!</h2>
<p>We are a fighting force for the average joe. We believe monetary tips shouldn't
    be limited to  waitresses alone. Why isn't your mechanic, general staff,
    the person who stocks the shelves receiving tips/gifts as well? We want to help level
    the playing field for everyone, give the average man/woman a shot at enjoying life.
    No kidding, working these jobs is tough and we know it. Giving gifts to those who bust
    their butts for us will make the Earth a better place!</p>

<p>I would like to receive tips on Grazie!</p>
